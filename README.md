Day 19 of 100.

main.py has code that, when executed acts like a sort of etch-a-sketch where the turtle point is controlled using the keyboard. turtle_race.py is a program that predicts what kind of luck you have (kidding). This program creates turtle-shaped turtle objects with set colors, the user guesses which colored turtle will cross the finish line first. They all move across the screen horizontally at random speeds from 0 to 10. In other words, through one iteration of the loop, a given turtle may move a distance of 7, while the next iteration is only 3,etc.
